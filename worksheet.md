# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

Red vs. Blue

# Task 3

Draw a 20 by 20 grid on a 720x720 window.  Each cell in the grid should be 35 pixels high and wide and the grid should be drawn 10 pixels off the top and left borders of the screen.  To do this, you should use the `Graphics` class from the Java libraries.  Be sure to consult the tips video for this task (it is a link in iLearn).  Without it, you will be very confused.
